## ✨ Features

- 📊 Real-time cryptocurrency balance monitoring through Binance API
- 💱 Support for multiple cryptocurrencies and fiat pairs (e.g., SOL/BRL, BTC/USD)
- 📈 Threshold-based profit monitoring
- 💾 Historical data storage in SQLite database
- 📝 Initial balance tracking and comparison
- ⚙️ Configurable profit thresholds

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 🔑 Binance account with API access
- 🔐 API key and secret from Binance

## 📥 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cryptobot
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Binance API credentials:
```
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Configure your desired cryptocurrency and threshold in `main.py`:
```python
threshold = 100  # in BRL
currency = "SOL"
fiat_pair = "SOLBRL"
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
python -m app.main
```

3. On first run, you'll be prompted to enter your initial balance in cents for the specified cryptocurrency.

4. The initial balance is stored in a newly created SQLite database file (`.db`) within the `/data` directory. This database serves as a reference point for future value comparisons.

5. The application continuously monitors the current value of your cryptocurrency against the stored initial balance, calculating the profit/loss in real-time.

6. The application will monitor the cryptocurrency value and alert when the threshold is reached.
